Problem 1
Given f : [a, b] → [c, d], f(x) = sin x.

Injectivity case
By the definition of injectivity, if f(x₁) = f(x₂) then x₁ = x₂.  The function sin x takes unique values on each interval [–π ⁄ 2 + πk, π ⁄ 2 + πk], k ∈ ℤ; therefore a must lie in such an interval, b in (a, π ⁄ 2 + πk], and c = min(sin a, sin b), d = max(sin a, sin b).

Surjectivity case
By definition of surjectivity, for every y in the codomain there exists x in the domain with f(x) = y.  Since –1 ≤ sin x ≤ 1, pick real c ∈ [–1, 1] and d ∈ (c, 1].  Then choose a = (–1)ᵏ arcsin c + πk and b = (–1)ᵏ arcsin d + πk, k ∈ ℤ.

Problem 2
For every subset B ⊆ A, the map f(X) is injective and surjective.
– For any B we can pick a subset of A such that f(X) is X or ∅.
– If two elements of X have the same intersection with B, they have different unions, hence different f-values.
– If two elements have different intersections with B, they also have different f-values because elements in an intersection are not in the symmetric difference.
Thus every value in the range is reached (surjectivity) and no two domain elements share the same image (injectivity).

Problem 3
Let f(x) = sin x – 5, g(x) = 2ˣ, domain A = ℝ.
Then f ∘ g = sin(2ˣ) – 5 with range [–6, –4].
Conversely g ∘ f = 2^{sin x – 5} > 0 for all x.
Therefore no x satisfies f ∘ g = g ∘ f; the compositions are not commutative.

Problem 4
Given f : A → B and g : B → C with composition g ∘ f:
– If both f and g are injective, then g ∘ f is injective.
– If both f and g are surjective, then g ∘ f is surjective because every c ∈ C has some b ∈ B with g(b) = c and every such b has some a ∈ A with f(a) = b.

Problem 5
Let f : A → B, g : B → C.

Subproblem 1
If g ∘ f is injective, f must be injective; otherwise two different a-values would map to the same c-value via g, contradicting injectivity.

Subproblem 2
If g ∘ f is surjective, g must be surjective; otherwise some c would be missed by all a.

Problem 6
Let g be a left inverse of f and h a right inverse.  From g ∘ f = id_A and f ∘ h = id_B we deduce h = g, so f has a unique two-sided inverse.

Problem 7
Subproblem 1: f injective ⇔ f left-invertible.
Subproblem 2: f surjective ⇔ f right-invertible.
Subproblem 3: f bijective ⇔ f has a two-sided inverse.

Problem 8
The inverse of g ∘ f is f^{-1} ∘ g^{-1} because f^{-1}(g^{-1}(g(f(x)))) = x.

Problem 9
A function is a triple (A, B, Γ) with Γ ⊆ A × B.  With |B| choices for each of |A| elements, there are |B|^{|A|} distinct functions.

Problem 10
The characteristic map f : 2^A → {0,1}^A is injective and, since domain and codomain have equal size, bijective.  Its inverse sends a Boolean vector X to the subset {a ∈ A | X(a) = 1}.

Problem 11
gcd(75217, 23521) = 1.

1, 1, 1, 0

Coefficients 2249 and –7192 give 2249·75217 – 7192·23521 = 1.

Problem 12
For m > n, 2^m – 1 ≡ 2^{m mod n} – 1 (mod 2^n – 1).  Iterating yields gcd(2^m – 1, 2^n – 1) = 1, so the numbers are coprime.

Problem 13
A linear combination of two integers is divisible by their gcd; extending by induction shows gcd(a₁,…,a_n) = gcd(gcd(a₂,…,a_n), a₁).

Problem 14
Solve 420x + 252y = 18480.
gcd(420, 252) = 84; one solution is x = –220, y = 440.  All solutions: (–220 + 3k, 440 – 5k), k ∈ ℤ.

Problem 15
The equation a₁x₁ + … + a_nx_n = b has integer solutions iff b divides gcd(a₁,…,a_n).  Proof by induction on n.

Problem 16
Find non-negative integers a, b, c with 1.61a + 1.76b + 1.89c = 13.61.
After scaling: 161a + 176b + 189c = 1361.  Solving yields the combination a = 4, b = 3, c = 1.  Thus 4 Coca-Cola bottles, 3 Fanta bottles, and 1 Schweppes bottle.
